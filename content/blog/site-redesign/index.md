The personal site was due for a change ... the last time I updated it was summer of 2017.

I just used the [Gatsby Starter Blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) repository and customized it, then published it to Github pages by using [gh-pages](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/how-gatsby-works-with-github-pages/).

Gatsby Starter Blog + Github pages FTW.
